# fire-safety

With this project, I wanted to showcase some details of fire safety. I decided to simulate a fire extinguisher since (A) it would be a fun way to teach younger kids how to take out a small-scale flame without exposing them to real danger, and (B) it's also a good way to teach adults who may have never used a fire extinguisher the proper technique, as well. 

A simple overview of this project is that a flashlight (your extinguisher!) will hit photoresistors on a simulated neopixel "fire", and if the photoresistors sense the flashlight at least 30 times, the fire will clear, indicating a completed effort. Because the photoresistors are located at polar ends of the flame, users will have to use a sweeping motion to reach both ends, which mimics the proper technique for using a real extinguisher.

For my next steps, I would like to incorporate a real fire extinguisher into this simulation. I could empty one and replace the cone at the end of the hose with a flashlight, so that users can simulate real usage of one by taking out the safety pin, closing the handle, and getting a feel for the sweep.
